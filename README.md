You will find here my personal recollection of various analysis performed on different datasets.

To conduct my research, I mainly use logic and curiosity. I question the data and unveil the underlying information in the data.

In my comments along the code, I put myself into the skin of a data analyst who has to report what he's doing and extract relevant information from the data he's provided with.

Code is here to answer these questions and implement this logic, but does not replace it.
